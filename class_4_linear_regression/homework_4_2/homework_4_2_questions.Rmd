## Instructions

For this problem set, you'll be analyzing gene dependency data using various machine learning techniques. Use the hints provided to guide your analysis. Remember to load the necessary libraries before starting:

```r
library(tidyverse)
library(tidymodels)
library(vip)
library(glmnet)
```

1. Load the dataset 'dependency_score_to_predict.csv' and prepare it for analysis. How many samples and predictors are in the dataset after preparation?

   Hint: Use `read_csv()`, `select()`, `rename_with()`, and `drop_na()`. Count rows with `nrow()` and columns with `ncol()`.

2. Create a scatter plot of the top 2 correlated genes with the dependency score. Use the viridis color scale to represent the dependency score.

   Hint: Calculate correlations with `cor()`, then use `ggplot()` with `geom_point()` and `scale_color_viridis_c()`.

3. Split the data into training and test sets using an 80/20 split. How many samples are in each set?

   Hint: Use `initial_split()`, `training()`, and `testing()` from tidymodels.

4. Create a recipe for preprocessing the data. Include steps for removing zero-variance predictors and normalizing all predictors. What role should be assigned to the 'cell_line' variable?

   Hint: Use `recipe()`, `update_role()`, `step_zv()`, and `step_normalize()`.

5. Fit a linear regression model using the preprocessed data. What are the top 5 coefficients (in absolute value) from this model?

   Hint: Use `linear_reg()`, `workflow()`, `fit()`, and `tidy()` to extract coefficients.

6. Evaluate the performance of the linear regression model on the test set. What are the RMSE, R-squared, and MAE values?

   Hint: Use `predict()` and `metrics()` from yardstick.

7. Create a scatter plot of the actual vs. predicted dependency scores. What does this plot tell you about the model's performance?

   Hint: Use `ggplot()` with `geom_point()` and `geom_abline()`.

8. Perform a feature importance analysis for the linear regression model. What are the top 5 most important features?

   Hint: Use the `vip()` function from the vip package.

9. Fit a simple linear regression model using only the SOX10 gene as a predictor. How does its performance compare to the full model?

   Hint: Create a new recipe with only SOX10, then follow the same workflow as before.

10. Set up a tuning grid for regularized regression (elastic net). What range of values are you using for the penalty and mixture parameters?

    Hint: Use `grid_regular()` with `penalty()` and `mixture()`.

11. Perform cross-validation and tuning for the regularized regression model. What are the best hyperparameters according to RMSE?

    Hint: Use `vfold_cv()` and `tune_grid()`.

12. Fit the final regularized regression model using the best hyperparameters. How does its performance on the test set compare to the original linear regression model?

    Hint: Use `select_best()`, `finalize_workflow()`, and `last_fit()`.

13. Create a variable importance plot for the regularized regression model. How do the top important variables compare to those from the linear regression model?

    Hint: Use `vip()` on the final fitted model.

14. Based on the results from both models, which gene(s) appear to be the strongest predictors of the dependency score? What biological implications might this have?

    Hint: Compare the top coefficients and important features from both models.

Remember to interpret your results and discuss their potential biological significance throughout the analysis.
