## Part 1: Palmer Penguins

1. Load the palmer penguins dataset and create a report of the table using the `dataExplorer` package.

2. Is there any missing data in the table? Show how many data points are missing using `dataExplorer`.

3. Using the reference of the `janitor` package, create summary tables of the statistics in the data.

4. Using the palmer penguins dataset, compute the average bill size per species and per island.

5. Create a plot of the bill size difference between males and females per species.

6. Which male population of penguins has the highest bill size?

## Part 2: Tidy Up Messy Data

For this part, we will work with the genomic dataset "class_1_yeast_microarray_genomic_data.csv"

1. Load the provided messy gene expression dataset.

2. Examine the structure of the data and explain why it is considered "messy" according to tidy data principles.

3. Use tidyverse functions to clean and tidy the dataset. Specifically:
   a. Separate the NAME column into its component parts.
   b. Remove unnecessary columns.
   c. Reshape the data so that there is one row per gene per sample.
   d. Separate the sample information into nutrient and rate columns.

4. Create a plot showing the expression of a specific gene (e.g., "LEU1") across different nutrients and growth rates.

5. Create another plot showing the expression patterns of all genes involved in a specific biological process (e.g., "leucine biosynthesis") across different nutrients and growth rates.

6. Briefly interpret the plots you've created. What biological insights can you draw from them?

## Part 3: Tidy Your Own Data and Visualize

Select a dataset that you want to work on for your final project. This could be a project you are already working on. Apply some visualization and data cleaning techniques on your own data.

1. Describe your chosen dataset and why you selected it.

2. Perform some initial data exploration and cleaning.

3. Create at least two meaningful visualizations of your data.

4. Discuss any insights or patterns you've discovered from your analysis.

Remember to use tidyverse packages when possible for data manipulation and visualization, particularly the more recent functions like `pivot_longer`, `mutate`, and `across`.
