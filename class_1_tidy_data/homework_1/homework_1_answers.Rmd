```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

```{r load_libraries, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(palmerpenguins)
library(DataExplorer)
library(janitor)
library(here)
```

## Part 1: Palmer Penguins

1. Load the palmer penguins dataset and create a report of the table using the `dataExplorer` package.

```{r load_data, eval=FALSE}
data(penguins)
create_report(penguins)
```

2. Is there any missing data in the table? Show how many data points are missing using `dataExplorer`.

```{r missing_data}
plot_missing(penguins)
```

3. Using the reference of the `janitor` package, create summary tables of the statistics in the data.

```{r summary_stats}
penguins %>%
  tabyl(species, island) %>%
  adorn_percentages("row") %>%
  adorn_pct_formatting(digits = 1) %>%
  adorn_ns()
```


```{r}
penguins %>%
  group_by(species) %>%
  summarise(across(where(is.numeric), list(mean = mean, sd = sd), na.rm = TRUE))
```

4. Using the palmer penguins dataset, compute the average bill size per species and per island.

```{r avg_bill_size}
penguins %>%
  group_by(species, island) %>%
  summarise(avg_bill_length = mean(bill_length_mm, na.rm = TRUE),
            avg_bill_depth = mean(bill_depth_mm, na.rm = TRUE),
            .groups = "drop") %>%
  arrange(species, island)
```

5. Create a plot of the bill size difference between males and females per species.

```{r bill_size_plot}
penguins %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = species, y = bill_length_mm, fill = sex)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(title = "Bill Length by Species and Sex",
       x = "Species", y = "Bill Length (mm)") +
  theme_minimal()
```

6. Which male population of penguins has the highest bill size?

```{r highest_male_bill_size}
penguins %>%
  filter(sex == "male") %>%
  group_by(species) %>%
  summarise(avg_bill_length = mean(bill_length_mm, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  arrange(desc(avg_bill_length))
```

## Part 2: Tidy Up Messy Data

1. Load the provided messy gene expression dataset.

```{r load_messy_data}

original_data <- here::here("class_1_tidy_data/homework_1/class_1_yeast_microarray_genomic_data.csv") %>% read_csv()

```

2. The data is considered "messy" because:
   - Multiple variables are stored in one column (NAME)
   - Column headers are values, not variable names (G0.05, N0.1, etc.)
   - Each row contains multiple observations (one for each nutrient and growth rate)

3. Clean and tidy the dataset:

```{r tidy_data}
cleaned_data <- original_data %>%
  separate(NAME, c("name", "BP", "MF", "systematic_name", "number"), sep = " \\|\\| ") %>%
  mutate(across(name:systematic_name, str_trim)) %>%
  select(-number, -GID, -YORF, -GWEIGHT) %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = G0.05:N0.3, names_to = "sample", values_to = "expression") %>%
  separate(sample, c("nutrient", "rate"), sep = 1, convert = TRUE)

cleaned_data
```

4. Plot the expression of the LEU1 gene:

```{r plot_LEU1}
cleaned_data %>%
  filter(name == "LEU1") %>%
  ggplot(aes(rate, expression, color = nutrient)) +
  geom_line() +
  geom_point() +
  labs(title = "Expression of LEU1 gene",
       x = "Growth Rate",
       y = "Expression Level",
       color = "Nutrient") +
  theme_minimal()
```

5. Plot the expression patterns of all genes involved in leucine biosynthesis:

```{r plot_leucine_biosynthesis}
cleaned_data %>%
  filter(BP == "leucine biosynthesis") %>%
  ggplot(aes(rate, expression, color = nutrient)) +
  geom_line() +
  geom_point() +
  facet_wrap(~name, scales = "free_y") +
  labs(title = "Expression of Leucine Biosynthesis Genes",
       x = "Growth Rate",
       y = "Expression Level",
       color = "Nutrient") +
  theme_minimal()
```

6. Interpretation of the plots:

The plots show how the expression of genes involved in leucine biosynthesis changes with growth rate and nutrient limitation. Some observations:

- LEU1 shows higher expression under glucose limitation (G) compared to nitrogen limitation (N), especially at lower growth rates.
- The expression of LEU1 decreases as the growth rate increases, suggesting that the cell needs less leucine biosynthesis when growing faster.
- Different genes in the leucine biosynthesis pathway show slightly different patterns, which could indicate different regulatory mechanisms or roles in the pathway.

These insights could help researchers understand how yeast cells regulate their metabolism in response to different nutrient conditions and growth rates.

## Part 3: Tidy Your Own Data and Visualize

For this part, you would need to use your own dataset. Here's an example of what you might do:

1. Describe your chosen dataset and why you selected it.
2. Perform some initial data exploration and cleaning.
3. Create at least two meaningful visualizations of your data.
4. Discuss any insights or patterns you've discovered from your analysis.

```{r your_data_analysis, eval=FALSE}
# Load your own dataset
# my_data <- read_csv("path/to/your/data.csv")

# Perform data cleaning and exploration
# my_clean_data <- my_data %>%
#   ... (cleaning steps)

# Create visualizations
# ggplot(my_clean_data, aes(x = ..., y = ...)) +
#   geom_...() +
#   ... (other ggplot layers)

# Discuss insights and patterns
```

Remember to replace the placeholder code with actual analysis of your chosen dataset.
