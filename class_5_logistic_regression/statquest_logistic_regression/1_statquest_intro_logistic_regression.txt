Awesome song and introduction
If you can fit a line you can fit a squiggle if you can, make me laugh you can, make me giggle stat quest
Hello, i'm josh stormer and welcome to stat quest today we're going to talk about logistic regression
This is a technique that can be used for traditional statistics as, well as machine learning so let's get right to it
Review of linear regression
Before we dive into logistic regression let's take. A, step back and review, linear regression in
Another stat quest, we talked, about linear regression
We had some data
Weight and size
then, we fit a line to it and
With that line, we could do a lot of things
First we could calculate r-squared and determine if weight and size are
correlated large values imply a large effect, and
Second calculate a p-value to determine if the r-squared value is statistically significant and
Third, we could use the line, to predict, size given weight if a, new, mouse has this weight
Then this, is the size that, we predict, from the weight although
We didn't mention it at the time using data to predict something falls under the category of machine learning
So plain old linear regression is a form of machine learning
We also talked a little bit about multiple regression
Now, we are trying to predict, size, using weight and blood volume
Alternatively we could, say that, we are trying to model size using weight and blood volume
Multiple regression, did the same things that normal regression did
we calculated r-squared and
we calculated the p-value and
We could predict, size, using weight and blood volume and
This, makes multiple regression a slightly fancier machine learning method
We also talked, about how, we can use discrete measurements like genotype to predict size if you're
Not familiar with the term genotype don't freak out it's. No, big deal just know that it refers to different types of mice
lastly, we could compare models
So on the left side we've got normal regression, using weight to predict size and
We can, compare those predictions to the ones, we get from multiple regression, where we're using weight and blood volume to predict size
Comparing the simple model to the complicated one tells us if we need to measure weight and blood volume to accurately predict
Size or if we can get, away, with just weight
Now that we remember all the cool, things, we can, do with linear regression
Let's talk, about logistic regression
Logistic regression overview
Logistic regression is similar to linear regression
except
Logistic regression predicts whether something, is true or false instead of predicting something continuous, like, sighs
these mice are obese and
These mice are not
Also instead of fitting a line to the data logistic regression fits an s-shaped logistic function
The curve goes from zero to one?
And that, means that the curve tells you the probability that a mouse is obese based on its weight
If we weighed a very heavy mouse?
There is a high probability that the new, mouse is obese?
If we weighed an intermediate mouse
Then there is only a 50% chance of the mouse is obese?
Lastly, there's only a small probability that a light mouse is obese
Although, logistic regression, tells the probability that a mouse is obese or not it's usually used for classification
For example if the probability of mouse is obese is greater than 50%
Then we'll classify it as obese
Otherwise we'll classify it as not obese
Just like with linear regression, we can, make simple models in this case, we can have obesity predicted, by weight or?
more complicated models in this case obesity is predicted by weight and genotype in
This, case, obesity is predicted. By weight and genotype and age and
Lastly, obesity is predicted by weight genotype, age and
Astrological sign in other words just like linear regression logistic
Regression can work with continuous data, like weight and age and discrete data like genotype and astrological sign
We can, also test to see if each variable is useful for predicting obesity
however
Unlike normal regression, we can't easily compare the complicated model to the simple model and we'll talk more about, why in a bit
Instead we just test to see if a variables affect on the prediction is significantly different from zero
If not it, means that the variable is not helping the prediction
We use, wald's tests to figure this out we'll talk, about that in another stat quest in
This, case, the astrological sign is totes useless
That statistical jargon for not helping
That, means we can, save time and space in our study. By leaving it out
Logistic regressions ability to provide probabilities and classify, new samples using continuous and discrete measurements
Makes it a popular machine learning method
Logistic regression vs Linear regression
One big difference between linear regression and logistic regression is how the line is fit to the data
With linear regression, we fit the line, using least squares
In other words, we find the line that minimizes the sum of the squares of these residuals
We also use the residuals to calculate r. Squared and to compare simple models to complicated models
Logistic regression doesn't have the same concept of a residual so it can't use least squares and it can't calculate r squared
instead it uses something called maximum likelihood
There's a whole stack quest on maximum likelihood so see that for details but in a nutshell
You, pick a probability scaled. By weight of observing an obese mouse just like this curve and
You, use that to calculate the likelihood of observing a, non obese mouse that weighs this much and
then you calculate the likelihood of observing, this mouse and
you, do that for all of the mice and
Lastly, you multiply all of those likelihoods together that's the likelihood of the data given this line
then you shift the line and calculate a new, likelihood of the data and
then ship the line and calculate the likelihood, again, and
again
Finally the curve with the maximum value for the likelihood is selected bam
Summary of concepts
in summary logistic regression can be used to classify samples and
it can, use different types of data like, size and/or genotype to do that classification and
it can, also be used to assess what variables are useful for classifying samples ie
Astrological sign is totes useless
